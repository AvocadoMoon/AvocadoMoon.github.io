        explanation: `The CTGrassRoots website is an instance of mobilizon, 
        a web application who's purpose is to facilitate in person gatherings. Some of it's
        features are:
        <ul>
            <li>Find events within a radius of a given location.</li>
            <li>Filter events based on category.</li>

        </ul>`

        header: "What does it mean to be a mobilizon instance?",
        explanation: `Mobilizon is a web application that can be copied and recreated
        by anyone who has the source code, and the developers actually emphasis trying to 
        make your own instances since it helps to disperse the power of just a singular instance.
        These separate instances can still communicate with each other though, creating a form
        of connected web allowing for all of these different instances to still feel as if it's
        one large website.`
    },
    {
        header: "If Mobilizon's code is already built by other people then what did CTGrassRoots have to do?",
        explanation: `Yes, I did not write Mobilizon software, but writing the web application software
        is only part of getting a website working. I like to think of it as building a car, if the web application
        software is already built then that's the engine being done, but there's still all the other components that
        a car needs to function. For example:
        <ul>
            <li>The body of a car which holds the people (database)</li>
            <li>Pedals and steering wheel (server interface, mailserver, domains, etc...)</li>
            <li>Safety features to prevent crashing and help diagnosis mechanical failures (data backups, logging, server security principles, etc...)</li>
            <li>Luxury features to make the ride more smooth (HPC clusters, database caching, high-availability, api integration, etc...)
        </ul>
        So even though one key component is already made plenty of other components need to be outsourced
        , built together making all pieces fit, then when done constantly maintained to ensure the car
        never stops functioning as a car.`
    },
    {
        header: "FOSS and Donations",
        explanation: `Although Mobilizon and the work I am doing to host this website follows the 
        FOSS (Free Open Source Software) mentality it does not mean that the labor put into
        creating this is free; for the free in FOSS represents unconstricted software that can be placed
        anywhere, not monetarily free.
        
        Thus, if you want to help off put the server costs for hosting this site, allow me to upgrade
        the site itself, and compensate me for all the time I've put into this, please donate to my 
        patreon <a href="">here</a>.`

        I never plan on selling anyone's data or implementing some sort of ad's system to make money.
        This means though that this server has a hard limit as to how much I'm willing to spend hosting it.
        If you want to help make this spending limit larger to have a better service, please look at the
        FOSS and Donations tab.`

        header: "Creating Community and CTGrassRoots Goal",
        explanation: `The main goal of CTGrassRoots is to help facilitate the growth of local organzine where ever 
        you may live in the CT area. A lot of time is spent on social media applications, but little to no time being
        social. Their algorithms keep you within a digital community that may not be representative
        of your physical community, and dampens introduction of new ideas/growth. 
        When in the normal school years of K-12-College there are extracurricular activities to promote
        social engagement, and immediately afterwards that social net is gone. Clubs that have people gather around
        an interest still exist but are difficult to find. Some ways to find events now are:
        <ul>
            <li> Be lucky and find a physical flyer in the streets. </li>
            <li> Happen to have a friend which know's about a spot. </li>
            <li> Social media algorithm throws a digital flyer your way in the sea of content it has. </li>
        </ul>
        Each method has its own merit, but it requires luck and a clunky method for keeping track of 
        events local to yourself. This website is meant to take that aspect of luck away, and allow
        you to focus only on growing your community, finding new ones, or just something to do
        on your time off.`

    {
        header: "Does this replace social media apps?",
        explanation: `No, not at all. Social media apps are meant for sharing moments with people
        in the digital realm, centered around entertaining the user to stay on the application.
        This websites goal is for in person gatherings, and will be for nothing more since it 
        doesn't need to be a super app.`
    },
    {
        header: "How can I the user help?",
        explanation: `There is plenty of ways to help CTGrassRoots them being:
        <ul>
            <li> Background in IT/Cybersecurity, audit the server or code base used to have the server running </li>
            <li> Grow your community wherever you live so the website can have a wider selection of events,
            thus having a larger group of acceptance. </li>
            <li> Report any malicious behavior and don't be an asshole. </li>
            <li> Make your own instance of Mobilizon and connect our instances together </li>
            <li> Promote the website and other FOSS softwares </li>
            <li> Donate if you have the income to do so </li>
        </ul>
