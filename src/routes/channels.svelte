    // Figure out how to use the transform function to do a matrix transformation for a zoom in effect.
    // It will require


    // 1). The edges of the object to move at different rates
        // a). For this it should not be a shearing in which it just stretches those edges without also moving all the other content
        // b). This will most likely be done automatically by the transformation, since if the entire transform needs to occur in a time frame,
        // then some edges will need to move faster than others to make them reach the edge all at the same time

    // 2). Calculate exactly where the edge of the screen is, and then use that to determine where the edges go

    // 3). Calculate edges with regards to nav bar at the bottom
