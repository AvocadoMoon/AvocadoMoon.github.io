For dealing with JS and HTML svelte will be used.

- Vite
    - Used for bundling the different svelte and other files together
    - When needed, "npm run build" allows for the code to be processed for production, serving native HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

For CSS either
- Tailwind
    - Allows for css to be written directly into the HTML 
    - HTML code can become very bloated
- Sass
    - An extension of css with the files being seperate from css
    - Use npx command to run Sass since its saved locally
